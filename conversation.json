Here are the steps:\n\n1. Install the `python-dotenv` library using pip:\n\n```python\npip install python-dotenv\n```\n\n2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.\n\n3. In the `.env` file, add the following line with your token value:\n\n```python\nTOKEN=your_token_value_here\n```\n\n4. In your Python code, import the `dotenv` library and load the values from the `.env` file:\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\nload_dotenv()\n\nTOKEN = os.getenv('TOKEN')\n```\n\nThe `load_dotenv()` function reads the `.env` file and loads its values into the environment variables, which can be accessed using the `os.getenv()` function. The value of the `TOKEN` variable will be the value you added in the `.env` file. \n\nNote that you should add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file to keep your secret values safe."}]}]
